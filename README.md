Forgotten kingdom is 2d scroling, sideview platformer and brawler,
set in ruins of once great kingdom, that fell in oblivion.
You fight your way into city encountering demanding terain and boss fights.

Player finds himself in ruins of an old kingdoms central city.
He needs to find his way through unforgiving terrain where one step means
plumeting to death. After reaching safety player is greeted by lone knight,
and door that leeds to boss room...

Character is controled by keyboard keys, A and D to move left and right,
SPACE to jump, H to attack, J to interact and R to restart level. 


## Features

- Dagger is data-driven and event-based.
- Dagger is extremely modular.
- Dagger is clear and clearly educational.

## Installation

You can clone and fully set up this project by simply running:

```git
  git clone --recursive https://github.com/UBIBelETF/dagger.git
```

Afterwards, run the solution file `dagger.sln` in Visual Studio 2019 to start playing around. 

## Resources

Any kind of data used by engine that is not source code is considered a resource. Root directory for resources is `data\`
and so all references to resoruces begin there. For example, if you want to get a texture (from `data\textures`) you would
use `textures\mytexture.png` instead `data\textures\mytexture.png`.

## Rights and Reservations

Dagger is made as a part of Ubisoft Belgrade's game development course. All rights reserved.
